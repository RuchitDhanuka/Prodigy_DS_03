# Customer Purchase Prediction Project

# **Overview**

**This project aims to predict customer purchase behavior using a decision tree classifier. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, profession, annual income, spending score, work experience, and family size, all of which have been label encoded for modeling purposes.**

# **Data Preprocessing**

**Handled missing values**: Filled missing values using appropriate techniques such as mean imputation or forward fill.

**Label Encoding**: Encoded categorical features like gender, profession, and family size into numerical values for model training.

# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Analyzed distributions of features using histograms, box plots, and violin plots to understand data patterns and outliers.

Explored relationships between features using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots to identify potential correlations.

# **Model Training and Evaluation**

Used a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on the encoded features.

Split the data into training and testing sets for model validation and evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
